discussions
===========

need help? or just wanna ask a question? [open an issue](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues) on this repo!

NodeSchool organizers can have discussions [over here](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers). If you want to create your own NodeSchool workshop, have a look at the [workshoppers repo](https://github.com/nodeschool/workshoppers).

# NodeSchool Discussions Rules

## 1 - Be nice

All of the workshops and all of the discussions are done by volunteers and there is no guarantee that all questions get answered. If you only provide negative feedback and not constructive criticism your issue will probably get closed with no response.

## 2 - Be public

Don't email workshop authors directly, use the public discussion forum (the Issues) for all communication, that way your question and any answers you get can benefit everyone else.

## 3 - Be patient

It may take a day or two for people to respond here. Please don't send multiple messages in a row, it won't help your question get answered any faster.

# Suggestions

## Provide full command output

To help us debug your problem please include all output from the commands you ran, including any error messages you received.

It also helps to include your node, npm, git or other CLI command versions, which you can get by running `node -v`, `npm -v` etc.
